# PROTIOT Course Lab 1: "Warmup" Lab Activity with Contiki-NG Cooja

## Introduction

Welcome to the initial lab session of our PROTIOT course! This activity serves as a **warmup** for familiarizing with the Contiki-NG Cooja network simulator. It's designed to bridge the gap between theoretical concepts discussed in class and their practical applications, preparing you for more in-depth lab / exercise work next week.

## Getting Started with Contiki-NG Cooja

Contiki-NG Cooja allows us to create, observe, and analyze the behaviors of IoT networks without physical hardware. Today, you will learn how to navigate and utilize this simulator, setting the stage for more complex experiments in the upcoming weeks.

**Objective:** Gain hands-on experience with the Contiki-NG Cooja simulator through guided activities and exploration, as a preparation for next week's lab.

## Lab Activities

### Activity 1: "Hello, World!" Simulation

1. **Task:** Begin with the "Hello, World!" simulation to familiarize yourself with the basic setup and operation of simulations in Cooja.
2. **Instructions:** Refer to the guide [here](https://docs.contiki-ng.org/en/develop/doc/tutorials/Running-Contiki-NG-in-Cooja.html) for detailed steps on setting up and running the "Hello, World!" simulation.
3. **Goal:** Execute the simulation and observe the output in the Cooja mote output console.

### Activity 2: Exploring Additional `.csc` Examples

After completing the "Hello, World!" simulation:

1. **Task:** Dive into at least two additional `.csc` example files provided with Contiki-NG. These examples offer a broader view of the simulator's capabilities and the complexity of IoT networks.
2. **Objective:** Understand different IoT network scenarios and the implications of various configurations and protocols.

## Deliverables

Your assignment is to compile a report that encompasses your findings and experiences from the lab activity, with a focus on analytical observations and reflections, gearing up for more comprehensive tasks next week. The report should be a maximum of 2 pages, excluding an appendix if needed for larger screenshots or additional materials.

### Report Structure

Your report should include the following sections:

- **Introduction:** Overview of the lab objectives and the simulations you conducted.
- **"Hello, World!" Simulation Summary:** Details of the simulation setup, execution, and outcomes.
- **Additional `.csc` Examples Exploration:** Insights gained from exploring and experimenting with additional example files. How do these simulations illustrate IoT concepts discussed in class (if applies)?
- **Simulator Exploration Insights:**
  - **Devices and Network Panel Exploration:** Observations from exploring simulator tabs, with a focus on the "Network" panel and the devices created. Relate your findings to concepts from the course (if any).
  - **Network Zones and Radio Messages Analysis:** In this section, focus on the detailed observation of the network visualization and radio communication analysis within the simulator. Follow these steps for a deeper insight:
	- **Zones Observation:** Select a node and zoom in on the “Network window” to observe three distinct zones (green, gray, and white). Describe the meaning of each zone, based on what you've learned in the course and any additional research. This will help in understanding the range and influence of a node within a network.
	- **Radio Messages Inspection:** Enable the display of radio messages through "Tools -> Radio Messages" and restart the simulation. By right-clicking on a frame and selecting “Show in Timeline and Mote output,” analyze how the frame corresponds across different simulator windows. Reflect on whether the examples provided help identify the MAC layer protocol used by the motes and what other information can be deduced from this analysis.
Include screenshots of your observations to enrich your report and provide a visual context to your analysis.
- **Concluding Reflections:** In this section, reflect on the broader implications of using simulation tools like the Cooja simulator for understanding and developing IoT systems. Consider both the opportunities and challenges presented by such tools. How do these capabilities enhance your comprehension of the IoT concepts discussed in class? Briefly discuss the impact of simulation tools on your learning and development in the field of IoT.

### Submission Details

- **Deadline:** 10/April/2024, 23:59 CET.
- **Format:** PDF, to be submitted via an assignment submission system in Moodle, which I will open for this purpose.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Explore and Experiment:** Take this opportunity to explore beyond the assigned tasks. The Cooja simulator is a rich tool for discovery.
- **Document Your Process:** Keep detailed notes of your exploration and any challenges you encounter.
- **Seek Support:** Don't hesitate to ask for help. Collaborate with peers and instructors to enhance your learning experience.

This warmup lab is your stepping stone to newer experiments in the next lab session.
